# Probabilistic classification of K-complexes

K-complexes are proiment features of sleep electroencephalography and could be a useful bio-marker of a wide range of clinical conditions. However, manual scoring of K-complexes is impractical, time-consuming and thus costly and currently not well-standardized. This repositery contains our K-complex detection algorithm published in SLEEP. The algorithm attributes a given waveform a probability of being a K-complex, thus making the scoring intuitive.

## Getting Started

The algorithm was developed in python 3.7 and requires the following dependencies:
